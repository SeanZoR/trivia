# Find the Hidden Shops

**Scenario:**

A customer (attacker) walks through the mall (cloud), asking every store if they belong to a VIP club (cloud resources) to figure out which stores have secret access areas.

**What technique is being used here?**

**Options:**

- A) Account Discovery
- B) Cloud Infrastructure Discovery
- C) Cloud Storage Discovery
- D) Network Service Discovery

**Answer:**

A

**Explanation:**
This is an example of **Account Discovery**. The attacker is looking for privileged accounts in the cloud infrastructure. Quote from [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1087/): _'Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of domain or cloud accounts to identify users or groups with elevated privileges.'_
