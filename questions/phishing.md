# Fake Sale Sign Frenzy

**Scenario:**

A customer (user) is walking through the mall (cloud) when they spot a large sign that looks like itâ€™s from their favorite shop (app). The sign promises a massive sale, and it points them to another part of the mall. Excited, they follow the sign, but instead of arriving at their favorite store, they end up in a fake shop set up to steal their wallet.

**What technique is being used here?**

**Options:**

- A) Exploiting Public-Facing Application
- B) Phishing
- C) Trusted Relationship
- D) Account Manipulation

**Answer:**

B

**Explanation:**
This scenario represents **Phishing**. Just like in the mall, where the customer is tricked by a misleading sign into entering a fake store, phishing involves deception to lead users into providing sensitive information.
