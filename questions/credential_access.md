# Steal the Keycard

**Scenario:**

A thief sneaks into the mallâ€™s (cloud) security office and steals a keycard (user credentials) to unlock all the stores (apps) in the mall.

**What technique is being used here?**

**Options:**

- A) Brute Force
- B) Credentials from Password Stores
- C) Use Alternate Authentication Material
- D) Modify Authentication Process

**Answer:**

B

**Explanation:**
This scenario shows **Credentials from Password Stores**. Stealing credentials from a key system allows the thief to unlock restricted areas (cloud apps). Protect against these attacks by using multi-factor authentication (MFA). More info: [MITRE ATT&CK: Credential Access](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/).
