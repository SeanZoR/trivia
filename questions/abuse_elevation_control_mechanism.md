# The Sneaky Bribe

**Scenario:**

A new shop owner (developer) opens their store in the mall (cloud). However, instead of following proper procedures, they bribe a security guard (IAM system) to get access to restricted areas of the mall and steal items from other stores (apps).

**What technique is being used here?**

**Options:**

- A) Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism
- B) Account Manipulation
- C) Privilege Escalation
- D) Command and Scripting Interpreter

**Answer:**

A

**Explanation:**
This scenario demonstrates **Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism**. In this case, the shop owner (developer) is bypassing proper security controls to access areas they shouldn’t. In cloud environments, this technique involves abusing privileged roles or permission settings to elevate an attacker’s access.
