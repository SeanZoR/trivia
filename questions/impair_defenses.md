# Disabling the CCTV Drama

**Scenario:**

A shop owner (developer) wants to stay under the radar while making changes in their store. They disable the CCTV cameras (cloud monitoring tools) in their section of the mall (cloud) to ensure no one can see what theyâ€™re doing.

**What technique is being used here?**

**Options:**

- A) Hide Artifacts
- B) Impair Defenses
- C) Modify Cloud Compute Infrastructure
- D) Modify Authentication Process

**Answer:**

B

**Explanation:**
This scenario demonstrates **Impair Defenses**. In this case, the shop owner disables security cameras (monitoring tools) to hide their activities. In cloud security, attackers often disable or tamper with logging and monitoring systems. Code snippet example: \n```\n# Disable logging\nlog.disable()\n```\n Find out more at [Impair Defenses - MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/).
